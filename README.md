#Finance Tracker
I built this project to refresh my Python skills. It is a simple tool to manage all your expenses in one place.

Features:

Add Expenses: Users can enter expenses under various categories. There is also an "Other" option to create your own category and add descriptions to remember where, when, and how much you spent.

Visualizations: View daily expenses as a pie chart, and track total spending for the month or year using a line chart.

Category Breakdown: Check how much is being spent in each category to help minimize overspending. The app also calculates the total amount spent each day.

Download Data: Users can download their expense report as a CSV or Excel file.

This is a functional platform built entirely using Python and Streamlit. It focuses on clean logic without complex animations.
